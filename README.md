# ðŸ§¬ Genetic Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning techniques
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict genetic disorders based on clinical and demographic data. With the growing prevalence of genetic disorders worldwide, early detection through intelligent systems can significantly improve healthcare outcomes by enabling timely diagnosis and preventive care.

# Problem Statement
There are approximately 30,000 genes in each human cell, and mutations in any of these can potentially lead to disorders. With an ever-increasing global population, the frequency of genetic anomalies is rising exponentially. A lack of awareness about genetic testing further contributes to this issue, often delaying diagnosis and treatment.

## Genetic disorders may arise due to:
* DNA mutations
* Hereditary transmission
* Environmental factors like radiation and chemicals

## Common genetic disorders include:
* Chromosomal disorders: Down syndrome, Turner syndrome
* Monogenic disorders: Cystic fibrosis, Sickle cell anemia
* Multifactorial disorders: Autism, Cancer, Diabetes

## Significance of the Project
This project aims to enhance the diagnostic process for genetic disorders through Machine Learning (ML), thereby:
* Allowing early detection
* Enabling preventive healthcare
* Supporting personalized medicine
* Aiding in drug discovery and novel disease identification

## Role of AI and Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML), a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), can process complex, high-dimensional medical data to uncover patterns and make accurate predictions. This project uses classification-based algorithms to analyze patient data and predict potential genetic disorders.
